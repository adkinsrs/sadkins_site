This is my first official post on the redesign of my site.  Previously, my (incomplete) site was created using HTML and CSS that I pretty much coded by hand.  It was nice, since it gave me some exposure on how the various HTML tags and CSS stylings work and come together.  However, I'd like to believe that design features are better left to people that do this stuff for a living, so I decided to give Jekyll a try.  The advantage of Jekyll is that, given a base template, you can quickly build a snazzy-looking website with just Markdown text.  If you are so inclined to do so though, you can customize this to a great degree by using various HTML layouts and SASS stylings.  I am planning on restyling as I go, though I have pretty much settled on the Gruvbox color-scheme, since that is one of my favorites.
