# Miscellaneous things
For this page I am going to keep track of various things I am doing, in list form

## Current podcasts I am listening to
I have more in my rotation than are in the list, but these are the ones I listen to most frequently (i.e. have topics that interest me the most)
* Punch Up the Jam
* Ologies
* Stuff You Should Know
* The Legacy Music Hour Video Game Podcast
  * Mostly for the "mixtape" episodes
* The Art of Manliness Podcast
* StarTalk
  * Mostly for the "Playing With Science" episodes
* My Brother, My Brother, and Me
* The Thomahawk Show
  * Not a fan of the Cleveland Browns by any means (Go Ravens!), but I like the dynamic of Joe Thomas and Andrew Hawkins. And I guess there is a charm in hearing from the perspective of another team's fanbase.
* Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend
