            <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
            
            <p>               
                I was born in Danville, VA in 1986, and essentially lived there my whole childhood.  I graduated from Dan River High School in 2004, and participated in various activities such as the band programs, varsity soccer (as a benchwarmer), and the SCAEL quiz bowl team.  I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the Piedmont Governor's School for Mathematics, Science, and Technology (PGSMST), and was able to become a Graduate of Merit.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I decided to attend Elon University in the small town of Elon, NC.  There, I graduated in 2008 with a double major in biology and in international studies (Asian/Pacific studies concentration).  I was also involved with several organizations on campus, including various band programs, the Emerging Leaders in Technology at Elon (ELITE), Biology Club, and Habitat for Humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Afterwards, I attended Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating in 2011 with a Masters in Bioinformatics (MBin).  If you were wondering, yes I was there during the magical 2011 Final Four run by the men's basketball team, and while I was very active in the basketball pep band at Elon, it pains me to say I never attended a home VCU game, which I still regret to this day.  While at VCU, I played a role in developing the Bayesian OTU eXaminer, or BOTUX, which is a novel software designed to cluster 16s rRNA sequences into "operational taxonomic units" (OTUs) without the use of a reference database

            <p>
                Soon afterwards I accepted a position as a bioinformatics software engineer at the Institute for Genome Science (IGS) in Baltimore, Maryland.  Over the years I have worked on various projects such as developing and maintaining code for Ergatis, Cloud Virtual Resource (CloVR), our API for the IGS Projects Database (IPD), and Manatee

            <h3>Five Quick Facts About Me</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I was born with cataracts and as a result my lenses were removed at a young age.  Sometime later as a kid, I was diagnosed with glaucoma in both my eyes.</li>
                <li>My band instrument of choice is the saxophone, specifically the alto.  I haven't played it in a few years though.  In high school, I did play auxillary percussion (xylophones) for a couple years</li>
                <li>Some of my favorite video games include Super Mario World, Borderlands, Final Fantasy IX and Chrono Trigger.  My favorite indie game is probably Super Hexagon by Terry Cavanaugh.</li>
                <li>Running has become a thing for me over the past couple of years.  I've cleared a couple of half-marathons already, and have lost roughly 50 lbs from running.  My favorite distance is still the 5k.</li>
                <li>I am a sports junkie.  I am pretty good with sports trivia, and love watching sports of all types, especially college sports.  The Chicago Cubs and the Baltimore Ravens are my 2 favorite pro teams, and the Virginia Cavaliers is the college team I grew up rooting for.</li>
            </ol>
